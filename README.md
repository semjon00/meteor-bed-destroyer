# meteor-bed-destroyer
An addon for Meteor Client.

Allows you to break bed blocks in Minecraft, in style. Some of the features are:
* Auto-aim
* Fake aim (server thinks the aim is correct, but you actually look in some other direction)
* Blink module integration
* Configurable reach distance
* ... and more!

The module breaks bed blocks only if they are not obscured, but it can reaches them trough entities!
I hope this module will be useful for playing Bed Wars minigame.
